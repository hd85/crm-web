HTTP & Intro to Sinatra

HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol
helps us define how info should be passed around the web

the entire world wide web is based off Requests & Responses

Client makes the request. server provides the response

What's in a Request?
- URL (Uniform Resource locator): an address that helps us represent a particular resource
- Request Method (like GET)
- Headers (Content-Type, etc)
- Sometimes a body

What's in a Response?
- Status Code (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc)
- Headers
- Body (most of the time)

HTTP is stateless
- State (or context) is never saved between requests
- The server will forget who you are each time
- Each new request needs to provide the right context
- Can be solved with cookies

Request Methods
- A URL alone isn't enough to do everything we need to do on the web
- We need an action / verb / method too!
- The most popular ones:
  - GET: fetch data
  - POST: create data
  - PUT or PATCH: update data
  - DELETE: delete data

CRUD
- These are the basic actions we do with data in a web application
  - CREATE
  - READ
  - UPDATE
  - DELETE

Response Codes
- 1xx: Informational
- 2xx: Successful
- 3xx: Redirection
- 4xx: Client Error
- 5xx: Server Error
